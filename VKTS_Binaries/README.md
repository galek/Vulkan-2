VulKan ToolS (VKTS) Binaries:
-----------------------------

This folder and sub folders contains all executables, shaders and assets. The examples are copied  
into this folder after the build.  
  
__This folder has to be the working directory, otherwise shaders and assets are not found__.  
  
Using Android, the needed asset files will be copied in the asset folder after executing `python build_project.py`.

Inside `shader/GLSL/` there is a python build script for the host system, which do compile all available GLSL source files.  
The resulting SPIR-V binaries are deployed into `shader/SPIR/V`.  

To enable the standard set of Vulkan validation layers, set the following environment variables:
  
Linux:  
`export VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation`  
`export VK_DEVICE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation`  
  
Windows:  
`set VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation`  
`set VK_DEVICE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_standard_validation`
